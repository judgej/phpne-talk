PHP Streams
===========

An overview of streams would be useful here.

A stream is a resource that has a streamable behaviour. The mean features of this is that:

* The stream is a linear sequence of data - it has a start, middle and end.
* A stream has no structure. The data in the stream may represent a meaningful structure to functionality elsewhere, but it is not a property of the stream.
* A stream is readable/writeable/seekable - pick any combination.
